## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1) Problem statement
- This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.

### 2) Data Collection

### 2.2 Data Card
- gender : sex of students  -> (Male/female)
- race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B,C, D,E)
- parental level of education : parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
- lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced)

### 3. Data Checks to perform

- Check Missing values
- Check Duplicates
- Check data type
- Check the number of unique values of each column
- Check statistics of data set
- Check various categories present in the different categorical column

### 4. Conclusions
- Student's Performance is related with lunch, race, parental level education
- Females lead in pass percentage and also are top-scorers
- Student's Performance is not much related with test preparation course
- Finishing preparation course is benefitial.
